      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <p>A full-stack application that manages a school's curriculum and allows registered teachers to create, view, edit and delete courses they offer.
        <ul>
          <li>The client and server were the ninth and tenth projects, respectively, in my Team Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Tech Degree bootcamp.</li>
          <li>I received grades of &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; (the highest available) for both projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Server (REST API)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Written in NodeJS and uses the ExpressJS framework.</li>
          <li> Handles user authorization, routing and MySQL queries asynchronously using Sequelize ORM.</li>  
          <li>Deployed using the Google App Engine on the Google Cloud Platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>The MySQL database is also hosted on Google Cloud using the Google Compute Engine.  Originally, the project utilized a simple SQLite database, but after I completed the Treehouse bootcamp I wanted to expand the project and my knowledge of hosted MySQL solutions, so I upgraded it.</p>
        <h3>Client</h3>
        <p>The frontend is written using ReactJS to display the site, interact with the server, handle data validation and make the site accessible. The site is deployed to Netlify and was originally written in React&#39;s older &quot;class&quot; syntax, but after completing the Treehouse bootcamp I completely rewrote it using React Hooks. This challenge was a way to get more practice using these newer functions, to better understand &quot;state&quot; and to streamline the app for deployment.</p>
