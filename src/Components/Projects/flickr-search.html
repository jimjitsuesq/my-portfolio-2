      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          <p> An app written in ReactJS that searches Flickr for photos using their API and displays them in a gallery.</p> 
          <ul>
            <li>The seventh project in my Team Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Tech Degree bootcamp program.</li>
            <li>Received a grade of "Exceeds Expectations" (the highest grade available).</li>
            <li>Used the Axios package to make asyncrounous fetch requests from Flickr.</li>
            <li>Used React Router to track, manipulate and harness the browser history to allow users to browse backwards and forwards through their searches.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The app was originally written in React's older "class" syntax, but after completing the Treehouse bootcamp I completely rewrote it using React Hooks. This challenge was a way to get more practice using these newer functions, to better understand "state" and to streamline the app for deployment.</p>
